Fetching data - guide

I will follow the below approach to check the related field data.

1) Aware of the input based on which the data should be fetched. In our case, it is a Child form's record ID
2) Check the source form to see if there is any direct lookup field available. In our case, there is no direct lookup field present in the form.
3) As a next step, I would see the available lookup fields in the source form and see if the Child Record can be filtered through the lookup field's related field
	
	childcareServiceBooking = Childcare_Service_Booking[Childcare_Bookings.Child_Name == input.ID.toLong()];
	if(childcareServiceBooking.count() > 0)
	{
		/*&&!childcareBookings.isEmpty()*/
		/********* beginning of Childcare_Service_Booking loop *********/
		for each  csBooking in childcareServiceBooking
		{
			chServiceBooking = Childcare_Service_Booking[ID == csBooking.ID];
			serviceType = chServiceBooking.Booked_Service;

			%>


<%=serviceType%>
